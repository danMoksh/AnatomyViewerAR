AnatomyViewerAR is an interactive mobile app designed to make learning human anatomy more engaging. By scanning specific target images with your device's camera, this app brings 3D models of organs and skeletons to life, allowing you to view and manipulate them in your own environment.

## Features

* **Image-Based AR:** Recognizes real-world images to display corresponding 3D models.
* **Multiple Anatomy Models:** Includes separate scenes for:
    * Heart
    * Brain
    * Skull
    * Full Skeleton
    * Human Body
* **Interactive 3D Controls:**
    * **Rotate:** Swipe to rotate the models.
    * **Scale:** Pinch to zoom in and out.
    * **Move:** Drag to reposition the models in your space.
* **Simple Navigation:** A clean main menu to select which anatomy scene to load.

---

## Tech Stack

* **Game Engine:** [Unity 3D](https://unity.com/) (Version 2018.2.14f1)
* **AR SDK:** [Vuforia Engine](https://developer.vuforia.com/)
* **Programming Language:** [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/)
* **Platform:** Android

---

## How It Works

The application uses the Vuforia SDK to identify pre-defined **Image Target(s)**. These targets are stored in a database (`AR_Demo.dat`) within the app. When the camera recognizes a target, the app instantiates the corresponding 3D model (e.g., `heart.fbx`) and attaches scripts to it, allowing for user interaction.

## Installation (For End-Users)
(Only compatible with Android 13 devices)

1.  Go to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/danMoksh/AnatomyViewerAR/releases) page of this repository.
2.  Download the latest `AnatomyAR.apk` file.
3.  On your Android device, you may need to **"Allow installation from unknown sources"** in your security settings.
4.  Find the downloaded `.apk` in your files and tap on it to install.

## How to Use

This app requires specific images to work.

1.  **Open the app.**
2.  From the main menu, select the anatomy model you want to see (e.g., "Heart").
3.  Either print the image or open it on another screen (like a tablet or phone).
4.  Point your phone's camera at the image.
5.  The 3D model will appear on top of the image. You can now interact with it!
